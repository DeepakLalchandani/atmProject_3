<h2>Brief Background</h2>
<p>
  In the development of this ATM project, I've adopted a comprehensive testing approach to ensure the highest quality. Here's a glimpse into my testing journey:

1. **Static Testing**: I started with static testing, reviewing the code, documentation, and design to catch and rectify errors early in the development process.

2. **Manual Testing**: I performed manual testing to understand the user experience and identify any unexpected behavior.

3. **Unit Testing**: Each component was tested individually to ensure that they function correctly in isolation.

4. **Unit Integration Testing**: After unit testing, I conducted unit integration testing where different components were tested together to check their interoperability.

5. **System Testing**: I carried out system testing to validate the entire system as a whole and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

6. **System Integration Testing**: Lastly, system integration testing was performed to verify that all systems integrated together function correctly.

While I've conducted a variety of tests, it's important to note that no amount of testing can guarantee 100% bug-free software. It's always possible that some bugs may surface in real-world usage. However, rest assured that every effort has been made to deliver a high-quality, reliable ATM project!

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
For an optimal and seamless experience with this application, kindly ensure you thoroughly read and follow the instructions provided below. Proper setup is key to unlocking the full potential of this application. Enjoy your journey!
</p>

<h3>Creating the Database</h3>
<p>
Ensure that the pgAdmin PostgreSQL database application is open. Navigate to the left-hand side and under 'Servers', select the appropriate server. Typically, this is labelled as 'PostgreSQL' followed by your version number, as depicted in the image below.

<p>
  Next, perform a right-click on the server you intend to use. From the dropdown menu that appears, hover over the 'Create' option and then select 'Database'.

<p>
  Upon opening the 'Create Database' dialog box, your primary task is to provide a name for your database in the 'Database' field. For ease of reference, you might consider naming it 'atmProject3' as shown in the example below. However, feel free to choose a name that suits your preference. By default, 'postgres' is displayed as the Owner, but we'll be modifying this shortly. 

Important: If you're new to JDBC and database connections, it's advisable to keep a record of the database name you've provided. This will be handy later when establishing the connection via the console upon application startup.
