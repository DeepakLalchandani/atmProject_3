<h2>Brief Background</h2>
<p>
  In the development of this ATM project, I've adopted a comprehensive testing approach to ensure the highest quality. Here's a glimpse into my testing journey:

1. **Static Testing**: I started with static testing, reviewing the code, documentation, and design to catch and rectify errors early in the development process.

2. **Manual Testing**: I performed manual testing to understand the user experience and identify any unexpected behavior.

3. **Unit Testing**: Each component was tested individually to ensure that they function correctly in isolation.

4. **Unit Integration Testing**: After unit testing, I conducted unit integration testing where different components were tested together to check their interoperability.

5. **System Testing**: I carried out system testing to validate the entire system as a whole and ensure it meets the specified requirements.

6. **System Integration Testing**: Lastly, system integration testing was performed to verify that all systems integrated together function correctly.

While I've conducted a variety of tests, it's important to note that no amount of testing can guarantee 100% bug-free software. It's always possible that some bugs may surface in real-world usage. However, rest assured that every effort has been made to deliver a high-quality, reliable ATM project!
